<h1>I Upgraded My Website</h1>

<h6>Monday, 7<sup>th</sup> January, 2019</h6>

<p>First things first, HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³</p>

<p>In the spirit of newness, I decided to give my website a fresh look, and finally add a blog section to it. I plan on putting up content not at as a thought-leader, but as a learner, who is happy to share things I find interesting and picked up while going through my daily activities.</p>

<p>If you haved looked at my <a rel="nofollow" href="https://kcodogwu.github.io/public/documents/kingson-chinedu-odogwu-cv.pdf">CV</a> or my <a rel="nofollow" href="https://linkedin.com/in/kingsonchineduodogwu">Linkedin profile</a>, you would see that I am currently a graduate student, studying stuff that has to do with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_forensics">digital forensics</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security">information security</a>. So, you can expect content related to these areas.</p>

<p>I also held a job as a software engineer, so you can also expect to see content related to that. I plan to learn and do some things with the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust programming language</a> this year. Would probably throw in some C, JavaScript, and Python, while I am at it.</p>

<p>I am also interested in software infrastructure stuff. I plan to learn more about containers (Docker and Kubernetes), Linux OS, Windows OS, Bash scripting, PowerShell scripting, and Git. So, some things connected to these mentioned stuff would be in my blog.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned earlier, I don&#39;t plan to write like a thought-leader, but from time to time I would probably put out opinion pieces. I&#39;ll also probably put up blog posts about random stuff I find interesting, occasionally.</p>

<p>Well, all of this, plus my everyday life activities, should make for an interesting 2019 for me. If you come across any of my blog posts, and read through it, I hope you will find it interesting and possibly fun.</p>

<p>I hope you have an engaging and interesting 2019. Happy reading.</p>
