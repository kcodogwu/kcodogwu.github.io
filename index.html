I and a group of friends were talking recently and someone asked a question along the lines of the title of this blog post. The programmers and tech folks in our midst, including yours truly, gave answers. While I left out a lot in my contribution to the answers to my friend's question, I thought it was a good question, and so I decided I would sit down and reflect on the question then come up with a post where I expand on the answer I gave to the question. <a rel="nofollow" href="/posts/how-would-learning-to-code-be-of-benefit-to-non-programmers/" alt="Read more">Read more</a>

First things first, HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³
<p>In the spirit of newness, I decided to give my website a fresh look, and finally add a blog section to it. I plan on putting up content not at as a thought-leader, but as a learner, who is happy to share things I find interesting and picked up while going through my daily activities. <a rel="nofollow" href="/posts/i-upgraded-my-website/" alt="Read more">Read more</a>
