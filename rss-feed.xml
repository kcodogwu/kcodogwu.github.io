        &lt;p&gt;First things first, HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of newness, I decided to give my 
	website a fresh look, and finally add a blog section to 
	it. I plan on putting up content not at as a 
	thought-leader, but as a learner, who is happy to share 
	things I find interesting and picked up while going 
	through my daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;
